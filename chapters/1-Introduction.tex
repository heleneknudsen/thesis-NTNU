%Introduction to IoT
The Internet of Things (IoT) exists of a growing number of physical devices connected to the Internet to perform smart tasks. \cite{IoTSurveyAl-Fuqaha} Every-day devices can be equipped with smart functionality to improve our lives, but also to improve critical societal functions such as in health care or industrial technology. The devices range from a robot vacuum cleaner that users can control through their phone or cameras installed for elders that stream to a nurse. These smart devices can communicate and connect to each other and other services on the Internet and makes out an IoT system. The devices analyzes how users, machines or eco-systems behave and act accordingly. An emerging request for smart devices has resulted in an rapid growth in IoT devices worldwide. \cite{Statistics on this}
