%Introduction to IoT
The Internet of Things (IoT) exists of a growing number of physical devices connected to the Internet to perform smart tasks. \cite{IoTSurveyAl-Fuqaha} Every-day devices can be equipped with smart functionality to improve our lives, but also to improve critical societal functions such as in health care or industrial technology. The devices range from a robot vacuum cleaner that users can control through their phone or cameras installed for elders that stream to a nurse. These smart devices can communicate and connect to each other and other services on the Internet and makes out an IoT system. The devices analyzes how users, machines or eco-systems behave and act accordingly. An emerging request for smart devices has resulted in an rapid growth in IoT devices worldwide. %\cite{Statistics on this}

%Introduction on Air Quality Monitors
We spend a lot of our lives inside, breathing in the air that is available in the indoor space. \cite{IndoorAirQualityMonitorIoT} The air affects our health and can potentially cause several chronic health problems, for example lung cancer or respiratory infections. \cite{IAQMonitorReview}

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Research Objectives and Research Questions}

The following research questions (RQs) have been raised and will be answered through this master:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    \textbf{RQ1:} What kind of private information can be gathered from air quality monitors when carrying out a network eavesdropping attack?\\
    \item 
    \textbf{RQ2:} What are the differences in level of inference from different air quality monitors from different vendors?\\
    \item
    \textbf{RQ3:} What are the differences in level of inference from network eavesdropping air quality monitors communication on different protocols?\\
    \item 
    \textbf{RQ4:} How can the private information gathered be misused by an adversary?\\
\end{itemize}
