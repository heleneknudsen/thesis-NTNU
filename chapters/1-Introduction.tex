    \textbf{RQ1:} What kind of private information can be gathered from air quality monitors when carrying out a network eavesdropping attack?
    \item 
    \textbf{RQ2:} What are the differences in level of inference from different air quality monitors from different vendors?
    \item
    \textbf{RQ3:} What are the differences in level of inference from network eavesdropping air quality monitors communication on different protocols?
