This document serves as my Master Thesis in Information Security and concludes my 3-year degree at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NTNU, department Gjøvik.

I would like to thank my supervisor, Jia-Chun Lin, for being a great support and challenging me to learn new things during my research and writing process. I would also like to thank everyone in our IoT-group: Benjamin Ulsmåg, Mathias Hedberg, Kevin Nordnes, Lloyd Nicolay Gustavsson, Aafan Ahmad Toor, Ming Chang Lee and Ernst Gunnar Gran for sharing their knowledge and being discussion partners througout this project.

At last, I would like to thank my partner Benjamin for supporting me in all phases of the thesis. I could not have done it without you.
