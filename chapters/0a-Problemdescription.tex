\chapter*{Problem Description}
IoT devices surrounds us\\
\\
Air Quality Monitors can be used to measure your indoor climate\\
\\
Having a device monitoring us 24/7 can gather private information about us\\
\\
Different vendors and communication protocols can have different standards\\
\\
Based on the problem description, the following research questions have been raised and will be answered through this master:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    RQ1: What kind of private information can be gathered from air quality monitors when carrying out a network eavesdropping attack?
    \item 
    RQ2: What are the differences in level of inference from different air quality monitors from different vendors?
    \item
    RQ3: What are the differences in level of inference from network eavesdropping air quality monitors communication on different protocols?
    \item 
    RQ4: How can the private information gathered be misused by an adversary?
\end{itemize}
