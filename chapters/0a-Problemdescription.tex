\textbf{Problem Description:}\\
Internet of Things are increasing in popularity and types of smart devices. Both devices that we usually use everyday, but also devices with new functionality, that we did not know we needed, are being produced as smart devices. As a result of the increased demand of Internet of Things devices, several vendors have started producing these devices. The variety of devices from different vendors and functionality gives the users many options when setting up their own Internet of Things system at home. 
\\\\
Air Quality Monitors are a type of Internet of Things devices that monitors the indoor climate in any users home. The devices communicates over different communication protocols to their apps or the vendors cloud storage. However, having a device monitoring us 24/7 arises some security issues regarding private information.
\\\\
This thesis will investigate several different Air Quality Monitors to see how and what private information can be gathered from conducting passive network eavesdropping attacks. The monitors should be communicating over different protocols and manufactured by different vendors.
